* What is _smalllisp?
  
  _smalllisp is a small lisp.  Currently it is interpretted, and there
  is no native-code or byte-code generation involved.

* Isn't 'smalllisp' a lame name?
  We are aware of this issue.  This project is so tiny that it didn't
  even deserve a proper name.  If it ever becomes useful we can address that.
